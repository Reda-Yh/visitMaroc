# Task: Special Offers on index.html and Code Testing

## Assigned to: Marouane Hajjouj

### Description:
The task involves two main objectives:

1. **Adding Special Offers on index.html**:
   - Implement a section on the homepage (`index.html`) to showcase special offers.
   - Ensure that the special offers section is visually appealing and aligns with the overall website design.
   - Add features such as highlighting discounts, offers with limited time, and special packages.
   - Ensure that the special offers are responsive and look great on both desktop and mobile devices.

2. **Testing the Code for Errors**:
   - Thoroughly test the `index.html` and other associated files for any JavaScript, CSS, or HTML errors.
   - Use browser developer tools and console logs to identify and resolve any issues.
   - Validate the HTML and CSS to ensure they are error-free and follow best practices.
   - Ensure that the special offers section functions correctly (e.g., dynamic content loading, animations, etc.) and does not break other parts of the site.

### Goal:
Ensure that the special offers section is added successfully to the homepage and that all errors in the code are identified and fixed to improve the overall functionality and user experience.
