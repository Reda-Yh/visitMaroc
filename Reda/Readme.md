# Task: Organize Style and JavaScript

## Assigned to: Reda Yahya

### Description:
The task is to organize the style (CSS) and JavaScript files for the Wanderlust Travel Agency project. This includes the following:

1. **Organizing the CSS**:
   - Ensure that all styles are consistent and properly structured.
   - Group styles based on components or sections (e.g., header, footer, destinations, blog posts).
   - Remove any redundant or unused styles.
   - Ensure that the styles are responsive and follow best practices for mobile-first design using Bootstrap.

2. **Organizing the JavaScript**:
   - Clean up the JavaScript files by separating concerns (e.g., separate DOM manipulation, event handling, and API calls into different files or sections).
   - Ensure all functions are well-named and properly documented.
   - Refactor the JavaScript code to improve readability and performance.
   - Optimize any event listeners or API requests to ensure smooth user interaction.

### Goal:
Ensure the styles and JavaScript are well-organized, modular, and maintainable for easier development and future enhancements.
